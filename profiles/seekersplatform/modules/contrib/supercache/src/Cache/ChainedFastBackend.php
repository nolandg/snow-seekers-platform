/**
 * Defines a backend with a fast and a consistent backend chain.
 *
 * In order to mitigate a network roundtrip for each cache get operation, this
 * cache allows a fast backend to be put in front of a slow(er) backend.
 * Typically the fast backend will be something like APCu, and be bound to a
 * single web node, and will not require a network round trip to fetch a cache
 * item. The fast backend will also typically be inconsistent (will only see
 * changes from one web node). The slower backend will be something like Mysql,
 * Memcached or Redis, and will be used by all web nodes, thus making it
 * consistent, but also require a network round trip for each cache get.
 *
 * In addition to being useful for sites running on multiple web nodes, this
 * backend can also be useful for sites running on a single web node where the
 * fast backend (e.g., APCu) isn't shareable between the web and CLI processes.
 * Single-node configurations that don't have that limitation can just use the
 * fast cache backend directly.
 *
 * We always use the fast backend when reading (get()) entries from cache, but
 * check whether they were created before the last write (set()) to this
 * (chained) cache backend. Those cache entries that were created before the
 * last write are discarded, but we use their cache IDs to then read them from
 * the consistent (slower) cache backend instead; at the same time we update
 * the fast cache backend so that the next read will hit the faster backend
 * again. Hence we can guarantee that the cache entries we return are all
 * up-to-date, and maximally exploit the faster cache backend. This cache
 * backend uses and maintains a "last write timestamp" to determine which cache
 * entries should be discarded.
 *
 * Because this backend will mark all the cache entries in a bin as out-dated
 * for each write to a bin, it is best suited to bins with fewer changes.
 *
 * Note that this is designed specifically for combining a fast inconsistent
 * cache backend with a slower consistent cache back-end. To still function
 * correctly, it needs to do a consistency check (see the "last write timestamp"
 * logic). This contrasts with \Drupal\Core\Cache\BackendChain, which assumes
 * both chained cache backends are consistent, thus a consistency check being
 * pointless.
